Test-Smart version 0.01
=====================

Test::Smart provides an abstraction layer for human checks. If you are in an
environment where you often have to manually check with an expert after a test
to ensure your program is working properly Test::Smart will automate this
process for you, allowing the expert to answer the yes/no questions and provide
feedback and you the developer to recieve pretty TAP output that you can feed
into your favorite testing tool, all inside a make test.

This is the very first release and as such there are some TODO features, it is
not yet ready for general consumption, but feedback is appreciated.
